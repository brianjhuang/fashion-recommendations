The chest area was just a tad loose, but that typically happens when I try on dresses...nothing a more padded bra couldn't fix!  The cut and fit were very figure flattering.  By the end of the evening I experience a little chafing under my arms from the sequins, but that was after 5 hours and it was very minor.  Thank you RTR for a great first experience, I'll definitely be back!\",\n",

I had originally rented an 8 and 10 and when I saw that the straps were quite long (make sure you wear them criss-crossed), I contacted the RTR customer service who suggested sizing down. I did that and ended up wearing the 6. It fit great. I wore a backless sticky bra and was good all day! The top is fitted, so that helped to keep everything still while I was on the dance floor, too. The dress was casual enough for a daytime, outdoor ceremony, but also dressy enough for the party. The material is heavy and elegant - I received compliments all day long! I have bigger hips and was still able to size down due to the full skirt. I would recommend that instead of sizing up where you may be inadvertently showing more side boob than you might want! Lastly, I wore the Tova Blue Mohawk earrings which seem like they were made for this dress. Compliments on those as well. I can always count on RTR to make me look like a million bucks!',\n",

It did not disappoint. I fluctuate between a 2 and 4 depending on the brand so got both sizes and went with the 2. The differences between the two were very subtle, I just preferred the smaller size since it was more fitted up top and I liked where the skirt fell lengthwise. It ran pretty true to size, but I thought the skirt fell longer than it appeared in the photo (and I'm 5 foot 6 so I normally don't have issues with length), but I didn't think it took away from the look at all. It was super comfortable which is high on my list, it was really fun to dance in, and was very unique in comparison to other guests at the winter wedding I wore it to.

I have an athletic body, longer torso, shorter legs. \\n\\nRE: FIT/STRETCH. Because there is no stretch it this at all, this fits true to size. So, if you are a 4/6 girl (like me), order the 6. Whereas, if you\\'re a 4/6 girl and you\\'ve been watching those sweets for a couple weeks, then you\\'ll be able to wear the 4.  I ordered both!  I was worried I wouldn\\'t be able to sit in this, but I was able to sit just fine, in both the 4 and 6.  I was \"worried\" that the sleeves wouldn\\'t fit my arms (I do back/bi and chest/tri every week), yet the sleeves were fit perfectly!\\n\\nRE: LENGTH/SEXINESS. I felt that the dress was appropriately long. By today\\'s trends, most gals would say it\\'s way too long. And in fact, it would probably be too long for a petite woman. However, for my Bridal Shower, it really made a lovely statement, by being sexy (with it\\'s illusion top and glittery \"burnt\" rose gold) without being too sexy (appropriate length, covered chest).  From the pictures, you can tell that I am very, very, very pale. The illusion netting was a different color from my skin, but I didn\\'t mind one bit. If that\\'s a concern of yours, you can always wear panty hose to match. \\n\\nRE: ACCESSORIES: I wore dainty drop pink pearl earrings and matching bracelet and my engagement ring. My shoes were plain nude peep-toe pumps.\\n',\n",

It's kind of off-the-shoulder, but not completely... anyway, it was fine but I was self-conscious about keeping the straps at exactly the right level (otherwise the material stretches in an unflattering way) so I wouldn't rent it again if you plan on dancing or moving around a lot. If you just need to sit and look pretty then it'll probably be fine. Other wise the dress was really pretty and I received a lot of compliments. One last thing; I am busty, and I was able to wear a strapless bra, but I had to be aware of the dress slipping down at times and exposing the bra on the side. Not a deal-breaker, but it wasn't a worry-free style for me. \",\n",

The 6 fit and I could have worn it... but when I tried on the 4 \"just in case\" I instantly felt it fit me better. My only problem was I felt the empire cut under the breasts didn\\'t allow much room for busty women. But I was able to squeeze my D\\'s in there and not worry about them falling out.

I tied the bow around the back of the dress because I did not like how the dropped hem looked with the bow in the front.

In order to play “Preacher’s Wife” I feel like I had to step up my game.\\n\\nAfter dressing like a disgruntled office worker to the first wedding I attended as an adult, I’ve spent years attempting to undo this mistake with mostly vintage dresses or rewearing the same few Dillard's jams over and over, desperately trying to style them into something fresh. Enter RTR and this lil beauty.\\n\\nPROS: GORGEOUS detail. Lace for days. Great length for a formal affair where you don’t want to show your lady business. Beautiful open back and delicate chest detail. Love the two pintucks on the front. Also really fun to style—it’s somewhat conservative on the body but took really kindly to punk and vintage styling. Tons of compliments! Looks pretty with pearls as well. AWESOME to dance in. Both top and bottom parts of the dress let you move without anything falling out.\\n  \\nCONS: I’m gifted in the booty department, so I was a little bummed to not have a more defined bum. The waist was defining but not as dramatic as I would have liked. I also have a smaller chest and found that I needed to wear a bra just to add some oomph to the top. The lace also may snag on a friend’s dangly earrings or a purse chain, so watch out! \\n\\nHMM: There’s a bustier / inlay whose inner clasp was broken when it arrived, but I was able to make it work without it!\\n\\nI’m still giving this thing a 5/5 because I loved my RTR experience and I see this dress in my dreams. We already miss each other. Come back to me, Shoshanna dress. \",\n",

The color was unmistakable, and I was the only one wearing red at the wedding, which made this an unforgettable dress! It was very comfortable to dance in. This dress fit snugly in the bust, waist, and hips. As I get a tad bloated after eating/drinking, this dress did show this by the end of the night. So I would not recommend to someone trying to hide the belly. I did not wear a bra nor spanx with the dress, as the material is very sensitive in the rear, and would have shown the spanx outline, so I decided to take them off. There is built in wiring/lining in the waist and bust. \\nCustomer service was extremely helpful.

The sequins are not overly gaudy - they seem the shimmer in the light! And the slit on the side is sexy but not too high. As others have mentioned, it is a big snug in the midsection, and runs a bit short. I ordered the 0L and 2L, and ended up wearing the 0L. I'm only about 5'5, but with my 4 inch heels, the regular would have been too short. The long worked perfectly! The midsection was a little tight, which is why I wanted the size 2 as a backup. The bust, however, is a big large for someone with a small chest, like me. I would have worn the 2L had the bust not been big on me. My advise is order a size up as backup, but if you are small in the bust, you may end up sticking with your usual size. It really is a lovely dress, and I highly recommend renting it!\",\n",

The length was perfect on me with 3 inch heels but if you are taller than 5'7 and plan on wearing heels I recommend going with the long length! \",\n",

I wore it on-air for a public affairs show and have been approached so many times since - not because of the interview, but because of this jumpsuit! The tailoring and the color made me feel truly regal. Plus you can wear it as a professional look or for going out. My only gripe (which is why there are four stars and not five) is that it's low cut. Like, crazy low cut. So low cut that I don't know how anyone wears it without pinning it or double sided tape. My tape actually started to give right before the interview, so I had to pull the back up with a hair tie at last minute. It totally worked and I felt very Fashion MacGyver, but would have been much easier if they simply put a clasp on the front.\",\n",

It was nice that you could wear a strapless bra underneath (although I didn't even bother since the dress was snug, secure, and thick enough to go without). A busty girl might want to avoid this one - I'm small chested and felt it was quite snug. Overall a cute, fun dress for the evening!\",\n",

Here's the catch-if you are busty at all, this is probably not the dress for you.  I am ordinarily a size 4 and asked for the 6 as a backup.  It's a good thing I did because I barely got the zipper up on the 4 in the chest.  It fit beautifully everywhere else but absolutely squashed my chest.  I had to wear the 6 and even that was a bit snug in the chest.  Unfortunately it was big everywhere else.  The 6 made my bottom half look much bigger than it did in the 4.  All in all it worked out but it would have been an over the top home run if the top were more proportionate to the bottom.  I can honestly say that this has never happened to me before so I do not feel like it's me.  If you are a B or less this is probably a perfect choice.   \",\n",

I feel like the style of the dress would fit any number of occasions, though. The color in person is very pretty and I received a lot of compliments on this rental!\\n\\nMy only issue was with the hardware of the dress. The dress stayed up, for the most part. There is a silicon strip at the top of the dress to help it stay in place, but the strip on the dress I received was partially worn away so I was tugging it up more often that I think is normal for that dress. Also, the zipper eye-clasp faced inward, so I had a few scratches on my side from the clasp rubbing against my skin. ',\n",

They are really an in between color, and will go with either gold or silver accessories. I wore it with gold accessories and nude/beige shoes. If you are going to have trouble with the fit of this dress it will probably be the top. I found the top to be a little too big around the shoulders, even when I wore the smaller of my two selected sizes. The dress is tighter around the bust but larger in the shoulders. Probably difficult to fit perfectly for a lot of body types. Both the 8 and the 10 fit but the 10 was really too big on top and you could see the edge of my bra through the arm hole. The 8 was still a little gappy and I was going to try to fix it with fashion tape. But I ran out of time trying to get the fashion tape right and ultimately I think it was fine to wear as it was.',\n",

It was very comfortable to wear and I got more compliments than I could count, which is saying a lot at a wedding of 25 people.

       "  'review_text': \"Overall, I loved this dress and I thought it flattered me very well.  But there were a couple of small things that made the dress a strange fit.  \\n1. The bust area is extremely loose.  It is simply two flaps that cross over each other so if you're not a full D cup (I'm a size 12-14 and am a 36 C) the flaps will sag open and you will show your undergarments.  I had to safety pin the front in two places so that it would stay close and unfortunately was self-conscious about it throughout the night (especially while dancing).\\n2. Because of the way the dress is designed, the hem is uneven if the bust is not filled out.  If the front starts to sag (which it did for me) it causes the whole dress to shift longer in the front and pulls up the back.  Being 5'10, I specifically rented a dress that was long on some shorter girls.  However, because the dress kept shifting to the front, I had to continually pull the dress down in the back because it kept riding up and getting shorter and shorter.\\n3. The material is surprisingly clingy and if you are fuller on bottom, it shows every line.  I would recommend a body shaper that allows a smooth line all the way from the waist to the thigh area (a leotard shape that just sucks in your tummy will cause a significant panty line).\\n\\nThe dress is stunning and flattering to curvy figures.  It just needs some adjustments to make it the perfect fit.\",\n",

       "  'review_text': 'The fit of this gown was spot on. I am usually a size 12-10. Depending on the brand. I ordered a 10L with a 12L as back up. The size 10 fit like a glove. As you can see, the 10L was actually a little short. The 12L was EVEN SHORTER, ;like 4 inches shorter (bizarre). I\\'m not all that tall. About 5\\'7\" in bare feet. My heels brought me up to about 5\\'11\" and the 10L still didn\\'t graze the ground (the 12L was UNWEARABLY short! Seriously, I almost wish I\\'d gotten the XL). \\n\\nI was very happy with how this dress hugged my curves. I have a very true hourglass figure, with just a bit of a tummy. This draping on this dress concealed EVERYTHING! I\\'m not kidding! It also helped with my \"less than perfect\" arms. \\n\\nThis dress has a good amount of stretch. The only thing I wasn\\'t crazy about was the amount of layers. The pictures don\\'t really showcase that the bottom has three layers: one stops right at your bum (so be careful if you are bottom heavy -- it will cut into you), the second helps show less leg behind the slit, and the top lies as you would expect. \\n\\nOverall, I would recommend this dress. It was very comfortable and it didn\\'t feel too heavy. I am big busted (36DD-36DDD) and I was able to wear a Spanx singlet and a normal bra. \\n\\nOverall, I would definitely re-rent this dress for a different occasion. I would especially recommend this dress for any event that is taking place in a ballroom or a hotel (which are notoriously COLD). I was comfortable throughout the event, while many of my friends complained of being cold. ',\n",

Definitely not church-appropriate and I am not even sure I would have worn it to something like a wedding, because it was tight enough that it crept up when I walked and I think by the end of a night with drinks, it would have been a bit much. I'd rent it again for something like a wedding or a Derby event, but I'd order a size up. The other thing I wasn't crazy about was that the exposed zipper is large and will not lay flat, so your backside looks lumpy from the side.

If I were any taller, this dress would have looked a little too scandalous for my taste -- something definitely to consider. RTR suggested that I wear a chunky necklace, but I felt it took away from the dress's details. Wore a pair of fabulous earrings with a bracelet and killer heels -- that's all it really needs! Super comfortable, no fidgeting issues whatsoever! And ladies, its definitely guy-approved! My boyfriend told me that I should go buy the dress :).

Just short enough to be \\'fun\\' without showing too much. Wasn\\'t too big on the bust (I am a 34B/32C), but wasn\\'t super tight either. I have hips and a butt, so I chose to size up and wear the 6 instead of the 4, just so I could drink and eat that night, but the 4 fit very similarly (just a smidge snugger on the hips). The pockets are always a plus and the material was super soft (felt like a brushed cotton). It also had a stretch to it, which also added to the comfort level. The sleeves weren\\'t too tight, also, and I have slightly more muscular arms for my size. Overall, a great dress you can wear to a work event, a wedding or a party! ',\n",

When you are standing it looks great, just be careful where you sit down.  I probably wouldn't rent this dress for a wedding because of how short it gets when you sit down, but for the event I went to I didn't sit down very long so it was fine.

It was a little big on me, but that's because I've been losing weight and overestimated the size, but it still hung very nicely and look radiant. The color is lovely. It's stretchy fabric, sturdy construction. I wasn't hot even though the wedding was outside. I could dance in it. I wore spanx and they didn't show because the hem is nice and low. I paired with nude wedge heels and they looked great. No jewelry needed. The dress is the statement. Lots of compliments from strangers. Made me feel fancy at a very fancy wedding. \",\n",

The open back was awesome (loved the draping) and a really cool way to show some skin, but that was the only thing that was really working for me. The straps were very thick and tight on my shoulders, and the bust was extremely small - not a problem I've ever had to face before haha! I would hesitate to try this again in a size up for fear of it slipping out of place - was quite low cut, so I wore petals instead of a bra. I unfortunately had to continually adjust while wearing, but I'm sure this would look fabulous on another lady! I definitely recommend sizing up.

This is not my typical style and I don't usually wear bright colors - but I got SOOOO many compliments.  The dress was a little on the loose side, and up until the day of the wedding I was going to wear my backup (which was a little too formal for a beach wedding) but then my friends talked me out of it and told me this dress looked really great.   PROS: pockets, love the damn pockets - perfect dress for a beach wedding\\nCONS:  I tend to be a little flatter on top, so if I had brought a padded bra with me or if I naturally had a larger chest then I think this dress would have felt like it fit perfectly.  \\nOne thing I would like to point out, I was under the impression when I rented the dress that this was a backless dress - but it's not (at all).  Completely fine to wear a bra with this dress - no special bra needed.  I would recommend this dress for others, but for me I will probably not rent it again since yellow isn't my color anyway :)\",\n",

I don't think ordering from a mobile devise works as great as doing it from a  computer as I ordered a size 6 for my backup, but when the order completed, it was not in the cart.) The 4 fit like a glove. It would have been perfect except I couldn't take a few steps without the skirt hiking/riding up. I felt self conscious tugging it down continuously. So if you plan to do a lot of walking, dancing, etc., I would advise you to go one size up. I think I would have been more comfortable with a 6. Overall, though, this is a very eye-catching dress. Having gotten several compliments from other women, I think, proves that.\",\n",

The skirt is a slight A-line, but it will cling to your hips and stomach a bit. I like the cut, since it makes this fabric more wearable for summer. The straps are large enough that you can wear any type of bra. The dress is somewhat low cut, with 34D breasts they are \"out there\". Definitely not good for work or conservative environments, but a camisole would fix that. For social outings, this is a very nice dress.

Secondly, it\\'s cozy without being terribly hot.

Not this time! Bare shoulders and arms but still comfy- but never too hot or sweaty. The fabric has a good weight to it without being too heavy. The dress just feels substantial. It almost feels like you are just carrying a nice throw/blanket around with you all night. The bottom of the skirt poofed nicely and the bodice fit perfectly. I had my 3rd baby 8 mo ago and am never sure of my size right now, but surprisingly fit into the 10L (170ish lbs and 5\\'10\") but I do not have a big bust or rib cage. Rented a punk rock style statement necklace to tone down the Queen Elsa vibe the dress may give off. Worked out fantastically.

I can't even count how many compliments I got when I wore it but a ton of people stopped me and I felt fabulous in it. I originally ordered the size four and the size two as my back up. After my night was over and the dress came off I realized I had worn the two and if fit fine, a little snug but I didn't mind! I was sad to send the beautiful gown back lol! Well worth the rent!

A couple of notes to share...The dress runs small (in my opinion) because it is so fitted in the bodice and hip area. I usually wear a size 6, but wore the size 8 and it was perfect. You need to buy a backless/strapless bra for this dress because the ivory lace back and inset on the front are see through. It's a sweet sexy detail, and you don't want bra straps showing! The color is a lovely muted blush rose color, and it blended perfectly with my daughters' dress (in photo). I wore this dress with Jessica Simpson nude platform pumps. Overall, it was a nice choice for this wedding event. \",\n",

       "  'review_text': 'I was a little disappointed when I received this dress. I ordered it to attend an opera auction, and when it came I almost went and purchased a dress. I had ordered an 8L and a 10L. I am only 5’7 but I usually wear at least a three inch heel with no platform. I ended up wearing the 10L even though I typically wear an 8, because the 10 hung better. I was unimpressed with the fabric, which I felt detracted from the quality of the dress. It was a slinky mesh material, so you could see every bump underneath it. I didn’t wear any undergarments because of that. I didn’t feel the dress was overly flattering on my body type. I have a wide rib cage, broad shoulders, big chest, and small waist. Despite how uncomfortable I felt in the dress or how I felt it looked on me, I received more compliments on that dress than I have ever before on any purchase.  I had men coming up to me saying the dress was stunning. The auctioneer referred to me as the “stunning lady in red” after I won a bid. Women approached me to tell me how gorgeous I looked. One woman said I looked like Anjelica Huston and another said Jessica Rabbit. Bottom line is the dress was a show stopper and very glamourous. It is also very comfortable to wear. ',\n",

I'm on the shorter, ~curvier~ side, and was looking for something colorful, cute, and conservative-ish for a pretty traditional church wedding. I love that this dress has a high neckline so I didn't have to worry about unwanted cleavage - sometimes you want the cleav, and sometimes you're in a church with a bunch of people you don't know and their grandmothers. The dress is comfortable, and the color is pretty and bright without being obnoxious. As another user mentioned, you will want a racerback bra (or no bra if you can), as the front of the dress cuts in a bit and the sides of my bra sometimes peeked through. The dress has those handy straps inside to hold your bra straps in, but there is a slight risk of side-bra exposure. Not terrible, but something to be aware of. Overall, I loved this dress and would rent again.\",\n",

The 4L also came without a zipper pull on top so I contacted customer service and decided to wear the 2L. The material has stretch so it hugs even the straightest of figures, I do not really have hips and my butt is fairly small, but it looked cute (I don't have a picture) I loved that I could wear a normal bra and thong with this dress. The material is high quality so it is not see through and is heavy enough that I don't recommend wearing it in the summer sun, however it is the perfect weight for inside events! I was able to dance all night, sit comfortably, and breathe in this dress without it stretching out. I paired it with sparkly drop earrings, a center French braid and slicked back pony tail up-do, and a sparkly bracelet to keep it simple.

The amount of compliments I received was crazy, but even more gratifying was how amazing I FELT in the gown. The only other dress I\\'ve ever felt so beautiful wearing was my wedding gown. \\n\\nThe bust on it was a bit big, but it was a simple fix for me, where I simply basted a couple of loose stitches on the inside, which were easily removed before I sent the dress back. Or someone without sewing skills, a padded bust cup insert would have been another good solution. \\n\\nThe dress was understandably very wrinkled when it arrived, but was easy to steam/iron for a perfect look. \\n\\nAnother \"pro\" for this dress is that it\\'s so stunning, you really don\\'t need flashy accessories to complete the look. Strappy, nude heels and a nice pair of earrings are all you need. \\n\\nThe dress is comfortable to wear, and light as a feather, so even on a hot summer night would be a great choice. \\n\\nI literally can\\'t say enough positive things about wearing this dress.

       "  'review_text': \"Ok, this dress is stunning. The fabric could not be prettier (it's a neoprene material, by the way). The pros are exactly how beautiful it is, that it is really warm for winter, and it has an overall very flattering fit. It is rather short by the way, so dark thighs may be a necessity. It has some cons though. The first one is that it has a weird fit in the arms. The opening between shoulder and arm is rather large, but then the fabric compresses the arm itself. So, it accommodates a thicker arm around the shoulder, but not at the biceps area. This was annoying, and I felt pretty uncomfortable wearing it because of that. Two other cons, which are no big deal: the sleeves are really long. It's ok for wearing it standing up, but if you need your hands at all you will have to bring the sleeves up, which is not very easy to do with this dress, and also loses part of  its charm. The second is that the dress is warm indeed, so you will feel hot if you are either walking a lot, dancing or just being at a warm enough venue. One thing which may interest some: I was 6 months pregnant when I wore it, and it does not compress the belly at all. I was quite comfortable there in spite of the bump, my discomfort was all because of the arms. \",\n",

The fabric is pretty heavy and does not allow for much stretch, and for that reason I would say this style works best for A to C bust sizes.  With the one shoulder look on this gown, I would suggest going with a strapless bra.  The natural waist is definitely very fitted, but it did allow comfortable room throughout the midsection.  I would suggest sizing up for fuller hips as that area is definitely quite fitted.  The one shoulder sleeve was definitely a bit tight on my broader shoulders, so that\\'s definitely something to keep in mind.  At 5\\'7\"  this hit right at the bottom of the floor without heels so I would definitely suggest a long length for women my height or taller.

I wore the 2  since it fit my waist better but I ended up with the oh so lovely armpit boob overflow all night. My other issue was the boning. The boning ends just at your natural waist and was pretty uncomfortable so after a long night of dancing I ended up with a scab on my hip where the boning rubbed. The length was perfect with 4 in heels. Of course being so short it didn\\'t have the same dramatic high-low look like the model but I still loved it.

I needed help zipping and unzipping this, but there was a really nice lady in the bathroom who unzipped me then waited for me so she could zip me back up! The sleeves are very long and bunched up at the wrists a bit. There are no button holes, so I used the holes in the lace to push the buttons through. I played with turning the sleeves under for a hidden cuff, and that worked too. It is also very low cut and so I ultimately wore it with cami underneath (one pic has cami, the other one doesn't).

As the event planner, I am constantly moving around and I am one of the people that starts dancing first so, that others would be encouraged to do so as well. The jumpsuit was a great alternative to a cocktail dress and allowed me to move with ease -- not to mention I was the only one wearing a jumpsuit so, it stood out nicely in a sea of dresses especially when paired with a statement necklace. The jumpsuit was true to size; however, the it was a little long so, heel height is key or fashion tape for the hem. The material also wrinkled easily which was a con for me. Overall this jumpsuit fits better than most and the material is most similar to crepe so, it did not add warmth, but kept me warmer than I would have been if I opted to wear a dress. The jumpsuit on the model looks more like a bordeaux color,  but in reality it was more on the purple side than  red.',\n",

Other reviews say it's a stretchy dress - there's a bit of give but with the satin liner, I wouldn't say it's a stretchy dress. It's got a very slim fit that hugs your curves - the medium was spot on for me. The black liner does sometimes show from the bottom of the dress. \",\n",

(I thought the 6 would be big but the dress runs small and was very form fitting. I wore Spanxx.)   I wound up returning my other dress and wearing this one. Perfect for a formal wedding because the sequin are subtle and the cut out in the back is tasteful (I'm usually super conservative so this was fun and adventurous to wear. I felt great!) I was able to wear a strapless bra with it (the first strapless bra I tried peeked out the back so try on multiple ones before you give up.) I wore bronze peep toe shoes & very minimal jewelry. The sequin did not irritate my arms like some users said. The slip does show on the bottom a little but I didn't mind. Overall, great dress if you want to step out of your comfort zone & have a little fun!\",\n",

I didn't give it 5 stars b/c there was an issue with the zipper where the teeth were missing right where the waist seam was so it was almost impossible to zip. If my fiancé and friend hadn't helped me I never would have gotten it on. It definitely runs a little small in the best, but otherwise had a great fit. I got tons of compliments & it was very comfortable. Some of the dots in the pattern are salmon colored which was not clear from the photo but luckily it still looked good on my pale skin.

Also, be sure to dig around in the bag for the black belt!  The fabric was very light almost like crepe paper. It added too much volume to my waist and hips. No go for my curves. :)',\n",

It was particulary large in the chest area, especially for a size 6 (which was a little big on me, but still worked). I\\'d say this dress is great for a curvy woman with a large chest and hips. Luckily, I was able to tie the back tight enough that it pulled the chest area in for me. Had it not been for the print it would have been noticeable that it was large in the chest area. You can\\'t wear a bra with it but because the material is printed you don\\'t need to worry about it being revealing. Overall, it fit well, especially on my short stature of 5\\'3\". The material was light, but had a lining so I felt comfortable in it and it was impossible to wrinkle the material.',\n",

RTR customer service is great!! \\nMy only fear in renting this dress and reading the other reviews was that it would be too short.  I am 5'6 and always feel like dresses are too short on me, even when they really aren't.  It wasn't THAT short, I did get away with wearing it, I was just mindful in any movements I made.  I was able to wear regular undergarments and it was not tight on my midsection.  It was a very comfortable fit. I was happy with this rental and received a lot of compliments on it.

Unless you are a true 2 I would highly recommend getting the 4R, and the 6R as back up, depending on the size of your bust. Sometimes I can wear a 2 depending on the dress, but I don't think the 2 would have fit me. This dress is fun, photographs well (especially while dancing and twirling), and made me feel so pretty. ***Look out for the long tulle back when getting out of vehicles or standing up from a seated position.

The 0 was a little snug around my bottom half, but the 2 was a bit loose at the top. I could have gone with either; I just preferred to have the top fitted so that the layer under the lace wouldn't dip too low. I ended up wearing a strapless bra with this (the back is high enough that it's covered), but I also probably could have gone without one. The dress was definitely longer on me that it is on the model, but the picture I included makes it look an inch or two longer than it actually was.\\n\\nAs an aside about RTR, I had scheduled the dress to arrive the day before I had to fly out for the wedding, but the UPS center lost power and the dress hadn't come before I had to leave. I called RTR (in a panic), and they had the dress (in both the original and back-up sizes) overnighted to my hotel for no extra charge. They didn't have the earrings I had ordered, so they sent me an upgraded pair. On top of all of this, the person I spoke with at RTR was so incredibly kind and made everything really easy. I'd recommend this dress and RTR to anyone!\",\n",

       "  'review_text': 'I was receiving compliments all night long. The dress is super comfortable and fun to wear. The shorter front makes it easier to walk, while the longer train adds the glam. The pleats and thicker fabric allow the dress to billow out too, which is lovely. I also loved the pockets. One thing to point out is that the dress is quite heavy so if you plan on dancing, be prepared to hold up your dress as people will step on your train. I give this dress a 4 out of 5, is because the dress had a bit too much room in the chest area for size 0. I am an A cup, and there was room in the dress for a C cup at least. I did read previous reviews that the dress was great for larger breasts, but I assumed the size of the cup would be adjusted for size 0.  Stick on cups were my best friends that night. ',\n",
